# PatchPatch

PatchPatch is inspired by a popular game played among the Israeli poker community during poker trips between tournaments, using real playing cards and chips. This version introduces unique twists.

## Game Overview

Each player is dealt **12 cards**, which they must split into **three flops** to create the strongest possible Omaha hands by the river. The game follows a structured betting round sequence:

1. **Preflop:** Cards are dealt, followed by a betting round.
2. **Flop:** Three flops are dealt, and players arrange their hands, followed by a betting round.
3. **Turn:** A turn card is dealt, followed by a betting round.
4. **River:** A river card is dealt, followed by a final betting round.
5. **Showdown:** Players reveal their hands to determine the winner of each board. Each board is worth one-third of the total pot.
6. **Next Hand:** The game continues with the next round.

## Future Plans

PatchPatch is designed to be easily scalable, with plans to support traditional **No-Limit Hold'em** and **Pot-Limit Omaha** games in future updates.
